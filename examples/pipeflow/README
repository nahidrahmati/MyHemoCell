Pipeflow
--------

The ``pipeflow`` case is a very generic case that can readily be used as a
basis for many other projects. The domain is a tube (loaded from ``tube.stl``)
with periodicity in the x-direction. The domain is (depending on the config
files) initialized with Red Blood Cells and Platelets with a hematocrit of 40%

The most important adjustable variables are in the ``config.xml`` file.

- ``<domain><refDirN>`` This controls how much fluid cells there are
  perpendicular to the flow direction, that is the same as the diameter of the
  pipe. One fluid cell usually translates to 0.5 Âµm in reality. Therefore, this
  parameter controls the size of your pipe!
- ``<domain><Re>`` Used to calculate the driving force of the periodic pipeflow
  system. The Reynolds number corresponds to the one that would be found when
  the system is run without any cells! Therefore, velocities might be a bit lower
  than expected with cells present. If you set this too high the simulation will
  become unstable!
- ``<domain><geometry>`` which stl file do you read in? The default is a simple
  periodic pipe.

The default ``*.pos`` file contains many positions for the red blood cells
generated by the ``packCells`` tool. When you increase the size of the pipe
more cells will fit but only according to these ``*.pos`` files. You might want
to create your own distributions with the following tool: :ref:`packcells`.
