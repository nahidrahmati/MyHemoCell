Cell collision with interior viscosity
--------------------------------------

This is the ``cellcollision`` case with added interior viscosity. This case is
used in the paper by de Haan et al. [#IV]_. To generate the cases necessary for
this paper please see the ``Generate`` folder and the README file therein.

The cellCollision case is a case with (usually) a RBC and a PLT that collide due
to a shear flow within the domain. The initial positions can be edited in the
corresponding ``CELL.pos`` files.

The most important adjustable variables are in the ``config.xml`` file.

- ``<domain><shearrate>`` This controls the shear rate that is present across
  the domain between the two velocity boundaries.
- ``<sim><interiorViscosity>`` This controls how often the interior and exterior
  fluid cells are determined at the boundary of the cells. If the cells move a
  lot this can lead to interior viscosity "leaking" to the outside, however we have
  not experienced this. This method has a low performance impact and can thus be
  called more often than the following function
- ``<sim><interiorViscosityEntireGrid>`` Recalculate the interior and exterior
  fluid of every cell exactly with raytracing. This is a very expensive method
  and thus should not be could that often.
