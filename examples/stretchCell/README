StretchCell
-----------

The ``stretchCell`` cases used for validation of the material models used in
HemoCell. A single cell is initialized in a domain with periodicity in all
directions. The only external force is on the outer points of the opposing sides
of the cell. In this manner the cell is stretched. This is validated against
experimental data.

To compile follow the steps in the user guide or run ``compile.sh``

The most important adjustable variables are in the ``config.xml`` file.

- ``<parameters><prctForced>`` controls the percentage of points forced in total
  (so half on each side). The number should be between 0-1.
- ``<parameters><stretchForce>`` This controls the stretching force and is
  defined in piconewton.

stretchCell must be run with only one processor, so either ``./stretchCell
config.xml`` or ``mpirun -n 1 ./stretchCell config.xml``. This is because the
helper that stretches the cell is not made to be used on multiple processors.

The results can be inspected as shown in the user guide, also there are two .gpl
files which can be used to create graphs of the stretch. Use the ``gnuplot``
program for this.
