OneCellShear
------------

The ``OneCellShear`` case is used for validation of the material models used in
HemoCell. A single cell is initialized in a domain with periodicity turned on
in all directions. Then the domain is sheared such that the top moves in the
positive x-direction and the bottom in the negative x-direction. The largest
diameter is reported and validated against experimental data.

The most important adjustable variables are in the ``config.xml`` file.

- ``<domain><shearrate>`` the shear rate in reciprocal seconds, used to
  calculate the top and bottom velocity boundary conditions.

Furthermore, it is possible to do tanktreading by adjusting ``''RBC''``
throughout the oneCellShear.cpp file to ``''RBC_tt''``. This loads the
different .pos file present within the directory (RBC.xml and RBC_tt.xml)
are the same.
