Hemocell - flowaroundsphere
---------------------------
This case simulates the flow around a spherical object that has been placed on the bottom of the channel. This mimics the experiments performed by [1]. The flow is driven by a velocity on the top plane of the channel, the bottom plane is a bounce back boundary and periodic boundary conditions are applied in the other directions. The size of the bead can be changed by varying the parameter: sphere_diameter. For examples see [2].
