Hemocell - microcontraction

This case simulates the flow through a microfluidic device that was used by [1]. The flow is driven by a body force and has a periodic boundary condition in the direction of the flow. The other sides of the channel are bounce back boundaries. The angle of the stenotic part in the channel can be changed by varying the parameter: c_angle_degrees. For an example see [2].
