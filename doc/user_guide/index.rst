HemoCell's User guide
====================================

*When using HemoCell please cite the corresponding HemoCell paper(s)*
:cite:`Zavodszky:2017`.

HemoCell implements an immersed boundary method with a lattice Boltzmann method
and langrangian structure points for the cells. The lattice Boltzmann method is
implemented with the help of the `Palabos`_ library.
On top of that HemoCell manages the structures (material, cells) and the
interactions between these and the fluid. The update of the forces of the
mechanical model of a cell are highly optimized as is the interaction between
the fluid and the mechanical model.
